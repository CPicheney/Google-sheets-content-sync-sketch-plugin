Edit and collaborate on your content in Google Sheets, then sync in back to your sketch files.

## Usage

### TL;DR
1. Create a Google Sheet ‚Äî enter titles across the top, and values directly below
2. Publish it with `File > Publish to the web... > Publish`
3. Name text layers appropriately ‚Äî e.g. `text layer #title`
4. Run the plugin ‚Äî `control + i`

### 1. Create your Spreadsheet

Create a new Google Spreadsheet (unfortunately Google Docs won't work with this.)

Enter you content going horizontally, with the titles on the first line, and the values directly below. **It is very important that you do it this way**

### 2. Publish the sheet

Next you need to publish the document, so that Sketch can read it's contents via the shareable link.

Do this by going `File > Publish to the web... > Publish`

### 3. Name your text layers

Now that the spreadsheet is accessible ‚Äî how do you tie specific values to text layers?

**It all comes down to how you name your layers**

In the name of a text layer, add a '#' followed by the title in the spreadsheet.

For example: to tie the value of 'title' to a Text Layer, give it a name like `#title`

Spreadsheet Data | Sketch Layer list
:---:|:---:
![Spreadsheet Data](images/spreadsheet-example.png) | ![Sketch Layer list](images/sketch-name-example.png)

> It is not case-sensitive, and will ignore spaces ‚Äî so `text #anothertitle` will still get the value for `Another Title`, you can also have other naming before the '#'. So `layer name #title` and `#title` would both work equally.


**Different Sheets**

If you would like to tie the data to a specific sheet within the Google Spreadsheet, add the sheet name to your Sketch page, otherwise it will default to the first page. *(Note: Only one Google sheet, per a Sketch page)*

Spreadsheet Sheets | Sketch Page list

**Multiple values for the same title**

You can give multiple values to the same title, by default it will grab the first one.

To get a specific value ‚Äî add the 'nth' one you want after a '.'

e.g. to get the 2nd title value a layer may be called `layer name #title.2`.

Spreadsheet Multiple values | Sketch Multiple values

### 4. Run the plugin

<kbd>‚åÉ control</kbd> + <kbd>i</kbd> to **import** the values from a spreadsheet. A popup alert will appear, allowing you to enter the URL of your Google Sheet.

Then click `Import`. That's it! üéâ The content should magically populate.

Anytime you want to re-sync the values, run the plugin again!


## Why make this plugin?

This is great for collaborating on content heavy documents, or when you may have a copywriter you work with.

There has been numerous times that I have been working on a large document with others, where we would collaborate in a Google doc. Then I would continually copy that content back into my Sketch design. This can be very frustrating after multiple iterations ‚Äî when you think you're done with the content, so you copy it all into Sketch; then more updates are made, and you have to copy them all again. üò°

This plugin really saves the day in that regard ‚Äî and has saved me a ton of time. üòç

Another use case, is having different versions of text across different sheets, to easily change between them.


## Installation

1. Download the plugin
2. Double-click the file, 'Google sheets content sync.sketchplugin'
3. That's it...
